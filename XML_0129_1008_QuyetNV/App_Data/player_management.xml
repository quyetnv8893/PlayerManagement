				He has been a Madrid fan since he was a child and he fulfilled his dream
				of playing for the club at the age of 10. Form the very beginning, it was clear that
				he was a special goalkeeper with extremely fast reflexes, great strength in both
				legs and the gift of being almost unbeatable in one-on-one situations. He has proved
				to be a born leader in all of the teams he has played for both at Real Madrid and
				for Spain. In his first Champions League Final, he performed brilliantly to help his
				team win their eighth European Cup. That same season, he played so well that he also
				won the Bravo Award for the best young player of the year. He has won everything
				there is to win, both for Real Madrid and for Spain. He was a key player in his
				country’s victories in the UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012 and was one
				of the Spanish heroes in the FIFA World Cup in South Africa in 2010. FIFA, UEFA, the
				fans…but, above all, his fantastic saves, honoured him with the title of the world’s
				best goalkeeper for five years running.

				He is quick, has great reflexes, always positions himself well and is one
				of the best in one-to-ones; Keylor Navas has everything it takes to be an
				exceptional keeper. He demonstrated it in Brazil, where he only let in two goals in
				five matches and took Costa Rica to the quarter-finals for the first time in their

				Marcelo started playing five-a-side football at the age of 9 and by 13 he
				was at Fluminense. He comes from quite a poor family and almost had to leave the
				football academy because he couldn’t afford to pay for the bus to take him to
				training. Nevertheless, his determination and his ability made him fight for what he
				loved and he was best at: football.
